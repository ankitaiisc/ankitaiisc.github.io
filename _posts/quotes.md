**<i>No Enemies</i> by Charles Mackay**

You have no enemies, you say? 

Alas! my friend, the boast is poor;

He who has mingled in the fray

Of duty, that the brave endure,

Must have made foes! If you have none,

Small is the work that you have done.

You've hit no traitor on the hip,

You've dashed no cup from perjured lip,

You've never turned the wrong to right,

You've been a coward in the fight.


**"In order to be able to think, you have to risk being offensive." ---Jordan Peterson**
