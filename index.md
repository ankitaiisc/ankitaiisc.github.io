# About 

<img src="./images/me_crop.jpg" width="200"/>

<p align="justify"> I am a <strike>first</strike> second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst advised by <a href="http://brenocon.com/">Brendan T. O'Connor</a> in the <a href="https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/">UMass NLP Lab</a>. I also work in collaboration with <a href="https://meedan.com/blog/fact-champ-launch/">Fact Champ</a>, an effort to investigate racially targeted misinformation and develop culturally appropriate interventions. I am broadly interested in misinformation detection, learning from crowdsourced/limited data, computational social science and natural language understanding.</p>

<p align="justify"> Previosuly, I also worked as an Applied Scientist in India Machine Learning team at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/">Amazon, Bangalore</a>, where I worked on problems such as - contextual bandits for recommendation systems and meta-learning. Earlier, I also worked in Advanced Technology Lab at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b">Samsung Research, Bangalore</a>. There, I worked on computational methods for detecting and analyzing misinformation on the web. Checkout my work in this area <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7nq1kBMAAAAJ&hl=en">here!</a></p>

<p align="justify"> I did my Master's from <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore </a>, where I was very fortunate to work with <a href="http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/faculty/sastry/">P. S. Sastry</a> and <a href="http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/faculty/gurunath/">Gurunath Gurrala</a> on Instability Prediction in Power Systems using deep learning methods.</p>
