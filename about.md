<img src="./images/me_crop.jpg" width="200"/>

<p align="justify"> I am a <strike>first</strike> second year Ph.D. student at University of Massachusetts Amherst advised by <a href="http://brenocon.com/">Prof. Brendan T. O'Connor</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/">Prof. Mohit Iyyer</a>. I am broadly interested in learning from crowdsourced/limited data, computational social science and natural language understanding. Recently, I have been working on event factuality models for political discourse analysis. </p>
 
<p align="justify"> Previosuly, I also worked an Applied Scientist in India Machine Learning team at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/">Amazon, Bangalore</a>, where I worked on problems such as contextual bandits for recommendation systems, inducing product taxonomy from user behaviour on e-commerce platforms and meta-learning approaches for curation of event specific products. I also worked in Advanced Technology Lab at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b">Samsung Research, Bangalore</a>. There, I worked on computational methods for detecting and analyzing misinformation on the web.

<p align="justify"> I did my Master's from <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore </a>, where I was very fortunate to work with <a href="http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/faculty/sastry/">Prof. P. S. Sastry</a> and <a href="http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/faculty/gurunath/">Prof. Gurunath Gurrala</a> on Instability Prediction in Power Systems using deep learning methods.</p>
